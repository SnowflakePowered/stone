# The CD-i came with a variety of controllers, such as the three button Gamepad, or the four button Touchpad.
# However, neither of these gamepads had any semantically distinct buttons other than the two 'action' buttons,
# that is; the 'third' button acted as a clone of Button 1 or Button 2.
#
# This makes the controller layout of both the Gamepad and Touchpad effectively semantically identical.
